Startupbootcamp is a three month business startup acceleration program that runs every six months for startups, entrepreneurs and small businesses across Europe to get ready for funding, launching and scaling to European and global markets.
As an Entrepreneur in Residence IT I was available to give hands-on support to the CTOs and software engineers, review systems and architecture, give talks on relevant topics and ensure business/tech prioritization and road-mapping went hand-in-hand.

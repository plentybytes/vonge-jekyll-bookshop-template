Triprebel is a hotel booking platform with a twist. After selecting your favourite hotel, we keep monitoring the market prices and if anything changes, we claim the better rate for you and refund you any monetary difference.
At Triprebel, I redesigned the software architecture, implemented the cloud infrastructure, designed ran product delivery processes, recruited the initial employees and helped shape our strategy.

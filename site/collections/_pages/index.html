        I really like cats, they are soft and fluffy.
        After working for a year at a coffee store, I am now a certified snob.
        My musical skills are unfortunately absent, but I compensate this with enthusiasm. I write poetry, sometimes, and ride my bicycle.

      <p>
        I have worked in London, Amsterdam, Hamburg and Berlin in positions of CTO and entrepreneur.
        I'm a product person, a storyteller, with a strong technical background and education, but also with an interest in marketing and great user experience.
        For me, a transparent work environment where I can contribute on a high level is most exciting.

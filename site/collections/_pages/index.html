      <p>Yenesika: Lawyer Turned Yogini</p>
      <p>
        After 6 years of practicing civil and commercial disputes resolution at the Delhi High Court, I decided I wanted to step up and build a life that I love.
        I found Yoga and knew instantly that it was my calling.
        For two years, I practiced daily and decided to become a certified teacher to pass on what I had found.

blurb: In the last six months, Yenesika has played a new role in my life - that of a yoga instructor. While I always knew the value of yoga, I was looking for a patient instructor who could help me understand my body and find my rhythm. I’ve long struggled with neck and shoulder pain (perils of my work). Yenesika helps me relieve the pain and tension in my body. She also keeps me on my toes and make me do cardio yoga sometimes (that’s a plus)!
